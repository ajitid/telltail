## Intro

With Apple's Universal Clipboard, you can copy content from one Apple device and paste onto another.  
With Telltail, you copy text from any device to any other device.

Tailscale helps you to weave a secure connection between your devices. And Telltail leverages that connection to transfer text over.

_Telltail is an independent project and is not affiliated with Tailscale._

## How it works

It has two parts:

- **telltail**: A program that stores the text you want across your devices, and
- **telltail-sync**: Interacts with 'telltail' and lets you copy and paste with your usual keyboard shortcuts. (Available for Linux (X11), macOS and Windows.)

This repository contains the former, telltail. Telltail Sync can be [found here](https://github.com/ajitid/telltail-sync).

## How it is made

I've published [a blog post](https://hemarkable.com/prose/telltail) about it which you can read to understand more.
